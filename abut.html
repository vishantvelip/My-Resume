    <p> A <strong>distributed ledger </strong>(also called a <b> shared ledger</b>or <b> distributed ledger technology </b>or DLT) is a system whereby replicated, shared, and synchronized digital data is geographically spread (distributed) across many sites, countries, or institutions.<sub>[1]</sub>In contrast to a <mark> centralized database, </mark> a distributed ledger does not require a central administrator, and consequently does not have a single (central) point-of-failure. <sup>[2][3]</sup>
<br>
      <br>
In general, a distributed ledger requires a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network and consensus algorithms so that the ledger is reliably replicated across distributed computer nodes (servers, clients, etc.).[2] The most common form of distributed ledger technology is the blockchain[citation needed] (commonly associated with the bitcoin cryptocurrency), which can either be on a public or private network. Infrastructure for data management is a common barrier to implementing DLT.[4]</p>

    <h2> Characteristics </h2>
    
    <p>Distributed ledger data is typically spread across multiple nodes (computational devices) on a P2P network, where each replicates and saves an identical copy of the ledger data and updates itself independently of other nodes. The primary advantage of this distributed processing pattern is the lack of a central authority, which would constitute a single point of failure. When a ledger update transaction is broadcast to the P2P network, each distributed node processes a new update transaction independently, and then collectively all working nodes use a consensus algorithm to determine the correct copy of the updated ledger. Once a consensus has been determined, all the other nodes update themselves with the latest, correct copy of the updated ledger.[5] Security is enforced through cryptographic keys and signatures.<sup>[6][7][8]</sup>
